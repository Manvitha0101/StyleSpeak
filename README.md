# The Problem

Every day, millions of people discover clothes they love on Instagram, Pinterest, movies, YouTube, or while walking down the street.

But when they try to buy them, they don't know what they're called.

People usually describe clothes like:

> *"That loose shirt with big sleeves."*

> *"Something Korean actors wear."*

> *"Office shoes that aren't boring."*

Current solutions don't solve this problem.

- Google Lens identifies products but doesn't explain fashion.
- Search engines require terminology users don't know.
- Store assistants struggle with vague descriptions.
- Generic AI chatbots provide one-shot answers without reasoning.

**The problem isn't search. It's translation.**

---

# The Solution

**StyleSpeak** is an AI Fashion Translator.

Instead of expecting users to know fashion terminology, StyleSpeak understands everyday language and translates it into professional fashion concepts.

```text
"I want a loose shirt with big sleeves"

            ↓

StyleSpeak translates

✓ Drop Shoulder
✓ Relaxed Fit
✓ Camp Collar
✓ Korean Casual

            ↓

AI Reasoning

            ↓

Complete Outfit

            ↓

Shopping Suggestions
```

# Why StyleSpeak?

Unlike traditional search engines or AI chatbots, StyleSpeak understands **intent**, not just keywords.

It converts natural human language into professional fashion terminology, explains its reasoning, recommends complete outfits, and teaches users the vocabulary behind fashion.

The result is an AI shopping assistant that feels like talking to an experienced stylist instead of a search engine.
